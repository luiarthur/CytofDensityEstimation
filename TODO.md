# TODO

- [ ] Implement `fit`
    - No need to keep `v` and `zeta` as the original `SkewT` parameters can be
      recovered from `psi` and `omega`.
- [ ] Simulate data
- [ ] Write Simulation Studies
- [ ] Methods for reading real data
- [ ] Methods for prior predictive
- [ ] Methods for plotting data
- [ ] Methods for post processing
    - [ ] Test that they work on server
    - [ ] Plot makers for each parameter
    - [ ] Credible interval for density estimate
