This experiment has `Ni=10000` and simulated data is realistic.

`psi` is fixed at 0; and `zeta` is also fixed at 0 so that the minimum amount
of code is changed. Thus, the model is a mixture of t-distributions.

The goal is to see if we recover simulation truth in this case, and compare
this to sim6. Ideally, with the same K as before (K=6) the model in sim6 should
perform better.
